// "type":"module"  : "type": "module" is used in a Node.js project's package.json file to specify that the project uses ECMAScript modules (ESM) instead of CommonJS modules. This allows the use of import and export statements for module management, enabling a more modern and standardized approach to handling modules in JavaScript.




// Concept about frontend(like tell about what is frontend and why use it).
// Frontend : The client-side part of a web application that users interact with directly, typically built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
// UI (User Interface) : The visual elements of a web application that users interact with, including buttons, forms, and navigation menus.
// UX (User Experience) : The overall experience a user has when interacting with a web application, encompassing usability, accessibility, and performance.
// SPA (Single Page Application) : A web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without refreshing the entire page.
// Framework : A pre-built collection of code and tools that simplifies the development of web applications, such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.
// Library : A collection of reusable code that can be used to perform common tasks, such as manipulating the DOM or making HTTP requests.
// Component : A self-contained piece of UI that can be reused throughout a web application, typically built using JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js.
// Props : Short for "properties", props are a way of passing data from a parent component to a child component in a React application.
// State : A built-in object that stores property values that belong to a component, allowing it to manage and respond to user input and other events.
// Lifecycle Methods : Special methods in a React component that are called at different stages of a component's existence, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting.
// Hooks : Functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
// Context : A way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
// JSX (JavaScript XML) : A syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, commonly used in React applications.
// Fragment : A lightweight container that groups multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
// Virtual DOM : A lightweight representation of the actual DOM that React uses to optimize rendering and improve performance.

// concept about component file and folder structure
// Component files are typically organized in a way that reflects the structure of the application.
// A common approach is to create a separate folder for each component, containing the component's main file, styles, and tests.
// This helps keep related code together and makes it easier to manage and maintain the codebase.
// For example, a component named "Button" might have the following structure:
//
// Button/
// ├── Button.js       # The main component file
// ├── Button.test.js  # The component's tests
// └── Button.css      # The component's styles

// what and why type concept clearing
// what is return and why use it?
        // return : A statement used in a function to send a value back to the caller.
        // In React components, return is used to specify what should be rendered to the UI.
        // For example, a functional component might return JSX that describes the UI structure.
// NavLink : A special type of link in React Router that allows for navigation between different routes in a React application.
// key : A special attribute used in React to identify elements in a list and optimize rendering.
// useState : A React Hook that allows functional components to manage state.
// useEffect : A React Hook that allows functional components to perform side effects, such as fetching data or updating the DOM.
// lucide-react : A library of customizable icons for React applications.
// useNavigate : A React Hook that allows for programmatic navigation between routes in a React application.
// Share2 : A social media sharing component for React applications.
// async : A keyword used to define an asynchronous function, which allows for the use of await within the function to pause execution until a Promise is resolved.
